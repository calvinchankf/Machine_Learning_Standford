Supervised Learning

Regression Problem
- think of a relation between continuous inputs continuous outputs
- training set (x(i), y(i)), i = 1,2,....n is used to come up with a learning algo to predict output y from input x. In which, f() is the thing that we care about.

Classification Problem
- classify inputs to discrete outputs

Unsupervised Learning
---

Clustering
- a machine is not given any output, but to define our to categorize data into clusters

Non-clustering
-  find structure in an environment(Cocktail Party Algorithm)
